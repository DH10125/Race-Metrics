## üèéÔ∏è Usage Guide

### 1. Car Setup Configuration
Start by configuring your car's specifications in the "Car Setup" tab:
- Basic information (car number, driver)
- Engine specifications (displacement, compression, timing, fuel mixture)
- Suspension settings (spring rates, shock settings, alignment)
- Wheel and tire setup (sizes, pressures, offsets)
- Weight distribution and balance
- Electronic systems (RPM limiter, data logger, etc.)

### 2. Recording Session Data
After each track session, enter your performance data:
- Track name and conditions
- Environmental data (temperature, humidity)
- Lap times and performance metrics
- Driver feedback and observations
- Mechanic notes and findings

### 3. Reviewing Recommendations
The system analyzes your data and provides recommendations:
- Review suggested changes and their expected impact
- Approve or deny recommendations with notes
- Track implementation and results
- Monitor performance improvements

### 4. Performance Monitoring
Use the dashboard to track your progress:
- View key performance metrics
- Analyze trends over time
- Compare session-to-session improvements
- Monitor setup changes and their effects
